      <h1>Joe Thel</h1>
      <h2>about</h2>
      <h3>me (computers)</h3>
      <p>I'm a web engineer living in LA, currently working at Ticketmaster. I've worked in a variety of languages, but most recent professional experience is in the React/Next/Node.js ecosystem. If you're looking to collaborate, please contact! In general I try to work in languages/problem spaces different from my professional ones. These days I'm hobbying in Rust and Haskell, but it's always subject to change.</p>
      <h3>me (music)</h3>
      <p>I'm an oboist, composer, and occasional singer. My work in all three is focused on the weirdness of performance, and what it feels like to watch that kind of fall apart (e.g. breaking an instrument, playing music that's impossible to "get right", doing one thing over and over again, or very slowly)</p>
      <h3>more</h3>
      <p>This website is an Elm experiment, so it kind of precludes a server render (at least, at time of writing). There's more content if you enable JavaScript!</p>
